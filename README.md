# Baseball

# This is the final project of the WBS Bootcamp.

# The data cleaning notebook can be used to transform data of the website www.baseball-reference.com into a Dataframe that can be used for Machine Learning

# Just choose a game from the Website, scroll down to the "Play by play" section and export it as a CSV. 

# If you want to analyze many games at once, copy and paste the CSV on a text editor of each game in a single file and save it as a csv.

# Some lines in the code will take care of deleting the rows that are not needed.

# The machine learning notebook shows a comparison between ML methods,
# but it was found that it is not possible to guess future pitches according to the current situation of the game

# An example of a game found on www.baseball-reference.com.
